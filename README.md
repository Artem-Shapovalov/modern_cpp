Modern C++ in examples

[![Build](https://github.com/Artem-Shapovalov/modern_cpp/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Artem-Shapovalov/modern_cpp/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This repo contains demo applications and it exposes the most useful and powerful modern C++ features. It may be used as a cheatsheet or quick start guide.

The actual standard is C++20. All of the examples are build with GCC.

Have fun!

- containers.cpp: how to convenient store your data and use it (array vector list set map queue stack deque tuple optional variant any)
- algorithm.cpp: how to effeciently interact with containers (ranges for-loop iterator sort copy remove erase find views)
- functions.cpp: moving from C-functions to C++ functional objects (functor std::function callback bind apply invoke lambda)
- memory.cpp: set of tools to easy manage the dynamic memory (smartpointers unique shared weak)
- move\_copy.cpp: how to share your data between the objects (move-semantics copy-semantics deep-copy shallow-copy constructors)
- multithreading.cpp: how to use the native threads and how to deal with concurrency (thread mutex semaphore future promise barrier latch atomic condition-variable)
- templates.cpp: a very basic templates usage example (type-deduction auto variadic-parameters decltype typeid)
